Notes can be styled using markdown and will persist through sessions.

Check out the **reference list** on the right side if you need to *brush up* on your markdown

Click the green edit button on the top left of each note to toggle editing mode. 

Most markdown features are supported with the exception of: 
    
  * Syntax Highlighting
  * HTML Rendering

You can jump to notes using the nav menu on the left side. 

This tutorial will always return if the note list is empty (*once refreshed*).
